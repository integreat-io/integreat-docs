# Motivation

The amount of data in the world is only increasing, the need for having data and content from different sources and services in the things we build is only becoming more real, but the standards for accessing data – and the correct implementation of these standards – are not evolving at the same speed. Time and time again, we will face the task of connecting to a badly designed or underspecified API, setup syncronization routines, write transformation functions from one data source to another, etc.

Integreat is an attempt at enforcing standards in a world of caos, of taking the most cumbersomb parts out of data integration, and enabling code reuse and sharing across projects, teams, and companies. The intention is not to compete with massive enterprise integration solutions, but rather to solve common problems for the JavaScript community in particular.

The core engine of Integreat is rather simple, but empowered with a standard interface for writing adapters and plugable APIs, it enables the growth of an ecosystem that over time may grow and have ready solutions for connecting to most known APIs and services – at least within modern web development.
